                <p>I am a junior Software Developer based in Dubai, UAE. As I approach the conclusion of my studies at Middlesex University Dubai, my enthusiasm for developing software solutions that tackle real-world issues continues to grow even more. Outside of my programming skills, I enjoy watching TV series like Suits and The Blacklist, captivated by their complex storylines and character arcs. Fitness is also a major part of my life; Iâ€™m dedicated to working out five times a week for at least an hour and a half each session. Additionally, Iâ€™m refining my chess skills with hopes of advancing to a more professional level.</p>
