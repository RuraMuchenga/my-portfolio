                    I am a junior Software Developer based in Dubai, UAE. As I approach the conclusion of my studies at Middlesex University Dubai, my enthusiasm for developing software solutions that tackle real-world issues continues to grow. Beyond coding, I have a strong interest in streetwear and sneakers, always keeping an eye out for the latest drops and trends. Fitness is also a significant part of my life, and Iâ€™m dedicated to working out five times a week for at least an hour and a half per session. Additionally, I'm refining my chess skills with hopes of advancing to a more competitive level.
